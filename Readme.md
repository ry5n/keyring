# Keyring

  Component to remove focus outlines for mouse only, retaining them for keyboard users.

  Based on Lindsay Evansâ€™ [Outline JS](https://github.com/lindsayevans/outline.js) inspired by ideas from [Paciello Group](http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2012/04/how-to-remove-css-outlines-in-an-accessible-manner/).


## Installation Options

  - Download one of the standalone packages; the Keyring object is available as a browser global at `window.Keyring`.

  - Or install with [component(1)](http://component.io):
    ```bash
    $ component install ry5n/keyring
    ```


## API

  ### new Keyring()

  Initialize a new Keyring singleton, which manages visibility of focus rings automatically.
